# Lab 6 - Quick Sort & Merge Sort
## Exercise 1 - Quick Sort 
  Extend the MyUtils class used in the previous lab by adding the method quickSortID.
  The method should implement the Quick Sort algorithm to sort an array of Student objects by student ID.
  In the TestSortUtils class, create an array of 7 elements containing Student objects.
  Sort the array by calling the quickSortID method.
  The student data will be entered as follows:
    1.First Name and Last Name will be provided during object creation (by calling the appropriate constructor of the class) in the main() method.
    2.Student ID and Year of Enrollment will be set immediately after object creation, using the setter methods setStudentID() and setYearOfEnrollment() in the main() method.
    You can use the appropriate methods from the UserInput class for entering these values.

## Excercise 2 - Merge Sort
  Extend the MyUtils class by adding the method mergeSortLastName.
  This method should implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of Student objects by last name.
  In the main program (TestSortUtils class), test the correct functionality of the mergeSortLastName method.
