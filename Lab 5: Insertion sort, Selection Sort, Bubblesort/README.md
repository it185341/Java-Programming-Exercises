# Lab 5 - Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubblesort
  ## Exercise 1 - Insertion Sort
  
  Enhance the MyUtils class created in the previous lab by adding the insertion sort method named insertSortID.
  This method will sort an array of Student objects using the insertion sort algorithm, based on their registration number (ID).
  In the main program (TestSortUtils class), create an array of 7 elements containing Student objects.
  Sort the array by calling the insertSortID method.
  
  The student data will be entered as follows:
    1.First Name and Last Name will be entered during the creation of the object (by calling the appropriate constructor of the class) in the main() method.
    2.Registration Number (ID) and Year of Admission will be entered immediately after the creation of the object using the setter methods setID) and setYear() in the main() method.
    These setters can make use of the appropriate input methods from the UserInput class.

  ## Exercise 2 - Selection Sort
  
  Enhance the MyUtils class by adding the **selection sort** method named selectSortLastName.
  This method will sort an array of Student objects using the selection sort algorithm, based on the last name of the student.
  In the main program , test the correct functionality of the selectSortLastName method.

  ## Exercise 3 - Bubblesort
  
  Enhance the MyUtils class by adding a bubble sort method named bubbleSortEE.
  This method will sort an array of Student objects using the bubble sort algorithm based on the year of admission. 
  In the main program (TestSortUtils class), verify the correct functionality of the bubbleSortEE method.
