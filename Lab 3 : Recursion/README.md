# Lab 1 – Recursion

## Excercise 1 - Recursive Prime Numbers
  A recursive program that checks if a number is **prime**.
  
  A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by **1 and itself**.  
  For example:
    - 7 is a prime → divisors: 1 and 7
    - 8 is not a prime → divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8
  
  ### Method: `isPrime(int number, int divisor)`
  - Recursively checks whether a number is prime
  - Returns `true` if the number is prime, `false` otherwise
  
  ### Extension
    - The program prints all **prime numbers from 1 to 10,000**

## Excercise 2 - Towers of Hanoi
  A recursive solution to the **Towers of Hanoi** puzzle using 3 rods and 4 disks.
    ### Problem Constraints
      - Only one disk can be moved at a time
      - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one
    ### Recursive Helper Method for Solving the Towers of Hanoi
      -You can implement the Towers of Hanoi using a recursive helper method with four parameters:
      -The number of disks to move
      -The source rod (where the disks are currently located)
      -The target rod (where the disks should be moved to)
      -The auxiliary rod (used as a temporary holding rod during the process)
